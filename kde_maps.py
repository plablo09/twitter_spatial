    Generate a KDE map of `xys`, potentially within the boundaries of `shp_link`.

    xys         : ndarray
                  Nx2 array with the original XY locations
    bw          : float
                  [Optional, default: None] Bandwith for the kernel. If left
                  blank, it is chosen by cross-validation as shown in the
                  following blog post:
                  http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/kernel-density-estimation/
    shp_link    : str
                  [Optional, default: None] Path to shapefile to use for
                  clipping the grid. If nothing is passed a grid on the
                  dimensions of the bounding box of the points is used.
    spaced      : float
                  [Optional, default: 0.01] Share in the range [0, 1] that
                  should be left between points on each axis
    ax          : matplotlib axis object
                  [Optional, default: None] If passed, the map is embedded into `ax`,
                  otherwise a brand new figure is created
    est         : KernelDensity
                  [Optional, default: None] Kernel density estimator in
                  scikit-learn. If none is passed, it initializes a new one
                  with the following parameters:

                        * metric='euclidean'
